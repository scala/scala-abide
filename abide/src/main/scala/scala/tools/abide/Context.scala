/**
 * Base trait for context generator objects that provide rules with shared context.
 *
 * If some information requires heavy computing and can be shared between two or more rules, it may be
 * useful to cache the result in a common place. To enable this, build a new type that extends the [[Context]]
 * type with these capabilities and provide these rules with a companion object that extends [[ContextGenerator]].
 * The abide framework will automatically load these objects and compute the lub of shared information for each
 * rule and instantiate the contexts accordingly.
 *
 * @see [[Context]]
 * @see com.typesafe.abide.sample.PublicMutable for a concrete example
